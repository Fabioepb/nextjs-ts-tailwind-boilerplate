# Nextjs, Typescript and TailwindCSS Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to accelerate further projects development, it uses Nextjs, Typescript, TailwindCSS configured to purge unused classes for better production optimization, PostCSS, Prettier for better auto formatting, Eslint configured for Typescript to help enforce strict rules during development, Husky to check for errors and Lint Staged to limit error checking only for files actually staged and speed up the project's deployment.
